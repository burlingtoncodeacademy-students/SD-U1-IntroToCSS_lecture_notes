## Challenge
Input the following code within your `index.html` file. The inline styling set within the `main element` is for simple display when you have your page within the browser. Altering that will not affect this challenge.

You will need to include the necessary properties within the elements to resolve this.

```html
  <main style="text-align: center; padding: .25rem">
      <h1>Header 1</h1>
      <h3>Header 3</h3>
      <h5>Header 5</h5>
  </main>
```

Using only three different selectors, style as such:
  - The `main` element needs to have a black background.
  - All three heading elements need to be white text.
  - Only the `h1` should be underlined

*Note:* When searching, try putting in queries like, "Underlining text in HTML" or "Underlining text + CSS". 

There should only be 3 different CSS blocks.
